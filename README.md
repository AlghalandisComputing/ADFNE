As of 12 June 2022 I put alghalandis.net offline to seek a proper, reliable and affordable web hosting solution. Due to other commitments it will take sometime. Meanwhile I uploaded the ADFNE1.5 package as a zip file here. It is password protected so you will need to read and accept the following License and then send me ( alghalandis . net @ gmail . com ) [disregard the spaces] the following registration information to open it.

- Full name
- Affiliation and Position
